# Appwrite-Starter
This initializer allows you to start creating projects with Appwrite faster.
I'll start working on this project in a week or two.

My current plan is to create a Vue.JS project that already has Appwrite and some additional stuff like Tailwind setup. I think utilising Vite.JS would allow for a better development experience and the option to extend this intializer to other frameworks at a later time, so I'll probably use that.

## Feel free to open an issue if you have a feature request.
